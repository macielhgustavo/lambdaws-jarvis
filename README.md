# J.A.R.V.I.S.

A browser voice assistant with an Iron Man holographic interface. Say
**"Hey Jarvis"**, he wakes, listens, and answers through your local FreeLLMAPI
router. The face is a web page (React + Vite + Three.js + custom GLSL). The
brain is any OpenAI-compatible model pool exposed by FreeLLMAPI.

The default brain is FreeLLMAPI on `localhost:3001`: add your provider keys in
that dashboard, copy the unified key, and JARVIS routes across the free models
you enabled. **ElevenLabs is an optional add-on**; without it he speaks and
listens through the browser's own speech.

---

## Requirements

**In one line:** FreeLLMAPI, Node.js and Chrome.

- **FreeLLMAPI running locally** — open its dashboard, add provider keys, and
  copy the unified API key. JARVIS expects `http://localhost:3001/v1` by default.
- **Node.js 20 or newer** — free, one installer from <https://nodejs.org>. This
  is a Node web app, so it is the one unavoidable tool.
- **Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge**, in a **real browser window** — not an
  embedded preview pane. Preview panes (including the one inside editors and
  Claude Code) block microphone access, so the page loads and looks right but
  never hears you. JARVIS also needs WebGL, which these browsers provide.
- **Optional: an ElevenLabs API key** — a good add-on, not a requirement. It
  gives a better voice and sharper transcription; the free tier is plenty for a
  demo. Without it, everything runs on the browser's own speech.

Run `npm run setup` after cloning and it checks all of this for you, in plain
language.

---

## Quick start

First, install, then start it:

```bash
npm install
export JARVIS_LLM_API_KEY=freellmapi-your-unified-key
npm start          # runs the FreeLLMAPI bridge and the face together
```

Then open the URL it prints (http://localhost:5173) in **Chrome**, click **INITIALISE**, and say **“Hey Jarvis”**.

Prefer two terminals? Run them separately instead:

```bash
npm install
```

Terminal 1 — the brain:

```bash
npm run bridge
```

Terminal 2 — the face:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the app in a **real Chrome or Edge window**:

```bash
open http://localhost:5173
```

Click **INITIALISE**, allow the microphone when asked, and say **"Hey Jarvis"**.

> It has to be a real browser window. Embedded preview panes block the
> microphone, so JARVIS will look perfectly alive and simply never respond.

---

## How it works

JARVIS is two processes. The browser is the face and the voice; the bridge is
the brain and the hands.

```
  ┌─ browser (the face) ───────────────┐        ┌─ bridge (the brain) ─────────────┐
  │  "Hey Jarvis" wake word            │        │  Node · bridge/freellmapi.mjs    │
  │  local VAD  →  speech to text      │   ws   │  FreeLLMAPI /v1 chat completions │
  │  reactor UI (Three.js + GLSL)      │◄─────► │  OpenAI-compatible routing       │
  │  text to speech                    │  8787  │  model fallback and free tiers   │
  │  heads-up display                  │        │  browser speech fallback         │
  └────────────────────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Everything you see and hear happens in the browser. The bridge is a single Node
process (`bridge/freellmapi.mjs`) that calls FreeLLMAPI's
`/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. They talk over a WebSocket plus `/health` on
`ws://localhost:8787`.

The default model is `auto:balanced`, which lets FreeLLMAPI choose from your
configured providers. Override it with `JARVIS_MODEL=auto:fast`,
`auto:smart`, `fusion`, or a concrete model id.

### The voice pipeline

The loop is designed so that nothing silently dies and barge-in feels natural.

- **Detection is local.** An energy-based voice-activity detector
  (`src/lib/vad.ts`) decides when you are speaking. It is instant, cannot quietly
  fail, and is what makes **barge-in** work — speak while JARVIS is talking and he
  stops.
- **Transcription has two tiers, chosen automatically at boot.** The browser asks
  the bridge `/health` and picks the best available:
  - **ElevenLabs key present** → ElevenLabs Scribe, via the bridge `/stt` endpoint.
  - **Nothing configured** → the browser's own `SpeechRecognition` (Chrome/Edge),
    guarded by a heartbeat so it recovers when Chrome throttles it.
- **Speaking** uses the **ElevenLabs voice when a key is present**, and the
  browser's `speechSynthesis` otherwise. If a cloud call fails it falls back to
  the browser voice, and if the OS voice itself is broken it latches over to the
  cloud voice.

So it works with no keys and auto-upgrades when a key appears — there is no flag
to set. Capability detection lives in `src/lib/capabilities.ts`, which probes the
bridge's `GET /health` (returning `{ ok, tts, stt }`, both tracking the
ElevenLabs key) once at boot and picks the engines.

## What JARVIS can do

Beyond answering, this default FreeLLMAPI mode gives JARVIS whatever text,
vision, image, audio, and tool-capable models you configure in the router.
The original Claude Code bridge is still available with `npm run bridge:claude`
if you later want MCP tool execution.

### Your tools

Every server in your `~/.claude.json` is handed to the SDK explicitly. Depending
on what you have installed, that is roughly:

- **Web & search** — `exa`, `serper`, `serpapi`
- **Images & video** — `higgsfield`, `openrouter-image`, `palmier-pro`
- **Voice** — `elevenlabs`
- **Your phone** — `android`
- **The browser** — `playwright`

A few things you can say:

- *"What's happening in AI this week?"*
- *"Generate an image of the Mark VII suit."*
- *"Take a screenshot of my phone."*
- *"Open my GitHub notifications."*

> **Note on account connectors.** Servers you added through your **claude.ai
> account** are not stored on disk, so the bridge cannot see them — it works from
> the servers in `~/.claude.json` (about 14), not the claude.ai ones.

### JARVIS controls the interface

He drives the UI through MCP tools the bridge exposes:

- `ui_theme` — accent, background, per-phase colours
- `ui_reactor` — colour, scale, intensity, spin, and style (`ring` | `sphere` | `wire`), visibility
- `ui_orbit` — put images in orbit around the reactor
- `ui_chrome` — show or hide rails, transcript, badges
- `ui_effect` — `glitch` | `pulse` | `scan` | `shake` | `flash`
- `ui_screen` — clear
- `ui_reset` — back to defaults

So *"make it red, hide the systems list, put that render in orbit"* is a spoken
command.

### The heads-up display

JARVIS authors panels with a `display` tool against a fixed `.hud-*` design
system. The browser sanitises the markup (DOMPurify, a class allowlist and a
strict CSP) before rendering. Rich media works — images, `<video>`, and
YouTube/Vimeo embeds. Remote images and video are fetched **server-side** through
the bridge (`/img` and `/media`, both SSRF-guarded), so hotlink-blocked news
thumbnails still appear and the page never beacons your IP to a host the model
chose.

## Controls

| Key / phrase | Does |
|---|---|
| **"Hey Jarvis"** | Wake him |
| **Space** | Talk without the wake word |
| Just speak | Interrupt him mid-sentence (barge-in) |
| **V** | Cycle the browser voice |
| **Escape** | Stand down |
| **D** | Live diagnostics panel |
| **T** | One-line audio self-test |

---

## The boot sequence

Power-up plays a four-beat Iron Man start-up (`src/ui/Boot.tsx`): an
"INITIATING SYSTEM" status bar with a segmented progress bar and boot log; then
concentric reticle rings resolving into "J.A.R.V.I.S"; then a suit schematic;
then the triangular arc reactor lighting up — with a start-up sound under it
(`public/audio/boot-music.mp3`).

---

## Configuration

Everything is optional in bridge mode. Frontend settings live in `.env.local`
(copy `.env.example`); bridge settings are environment variables.

### Bridge

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `JARVIS_BRIDGE_PORT` | `8787` | Port for the WebSocket + HTTP endpoints |
| `JARVIS_LLM_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3001/v1` | FreeLLMAPI/OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `JARVIS_LLM_API_KEY` | — | FreeLLMAPI unified key from the dashboard |
| `JARVIS_MODEL` | `auto:balanced` | FreeLLMAPI model or routing strategy |
| `JARVIS_BRIDGE_PORT` | `8787` | Port for the WebSocket + HTTP endpoints |
| `JARVIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | local dev | Extra WebSocket origins to accept |
| `JARVIS_ALLOW_NO_ORIGIN` | off | Accept connections with no `Origin` header |

### Frontend (`.env.local`)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VITE_BACKEND` | `bridge` (default) or `direct` |
| `VITE_BRIDGE_URL` | Where to reach the bridge |
| `VITE_TTS_ENGINE` | `system` or `kokoro` |
| `VITE_KOKORO_VOICE` | Voice for the Kokoro engine |
| `VITE_USE_ELEVENLABS` | Force the ElevenLabs voice on |
| `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Direct mode only |

### Adding an ElevenLabs key

You do not have to touch a flag. Either:

- Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` on the bridge before starting it, **or**
- Add the key to your `elevenlabs` MCP server's env in `~/.claude.json` — the
  bridge reads it from there too.

Either way, `/health` starts reporting the capability, the browser picks it up on
the next boot, and both the voice and transcription upgrade automatically.

## Enabling actions

The default FreeLLMAPI bridge is an inference bridge: it sends the conversation
to your configured FreeLLMAPI router and streams the answer back to the UI.
Local actions such as browser driving, filesystem edits, phone control, and MCP
execution belong to the optional Claude Code bridge.

If you later install and log into Claude Code, you can run the original bridge:

```bash
npm run bridge:claude
```

To allow effectful Claude Code tools, run:

```bash
npm run bridge:claude:writes
```

> Read `decideTool()` in `bridge/server.mjs` before you do. *"Hey Jarvis,
> clean up my downloads folder"* means something rather different with writes
> enabled.

---

## Troubleshooting

**I can't hear him, or he can't hear me.** Press **D** for the diagnostics panel
— it states plainly whether he is hearing you and whether he is producing sound.
Press **T** for a one-line audio self-test.

**No voice at all.** You must be in **Chrome or Edge**, in a **real browser
window** (not an embedded preview), and you must have **allowed the microphone**.

**Bridge not reachable.** Check that `npm run bridge` is still running in its
terminal, and that nothing else is holding port `8787`.

---

## Security

The default FreeLLMAPI bridge lives in `bridge/freellmapi.mjs`. The original Claude Code bridge lives in `bridge/server.mjs`:

- The WebSocket accepts only local dev origins (add more with
  `JARVIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
- `/file`, `/img` and `/media` validate the scheme, confine to allowed roots,
  resolve the real path, and refuse private and loopback addresses (SSRF guard).
- The tool gate (`decideTool`) is default-deny for effectful MCP tools.
- A strict CSP in `index.html`; model-authored panel HTML is sanitised.
